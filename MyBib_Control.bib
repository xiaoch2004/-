  abstract = {We present a novel distributed algorithm for convex constrained optimization problems that are subject to noise corruption and uncertainties. The proposed scheme can be classified as a distributed stochastic approximation method, where a unique feature here is that we allow for multiple noise terms to appear in both the computation and communication stages of the distributed iterative process. Specifically, we consider problems that involve multiple agents optimizing a separable convex objective function subject to convex local constraints and linear coupling constraints. This is a richer class of problems compared to those that can be handled by existing distributed stochastic approximation methods which consider only consensus constraints and fewer sources of noise. The proposed algorithm utilizes the augmented Lagrangian (AL) framework, which has been widely used recently to solve deterministic optimization problems in a distributed way. We show that the proposed method generates sequences of primal and dual variables that converge to their respective optimal sets almost surely.},

In most of the existing fault estimation approaches, the observer matching condition should be satisfied. However, this condition is hard to meet for many systems. To overcome this restriction, a new fault estimation method is proposed, where an intermediate variable is introduced and a specially designed intermediate estimator is proposed to estimate the state and the faults simultaneously by exploiting the properties of fault distribution matrix. It is proved that the states of the error system are uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulation examples verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

This technical note focuses on adaptive dynamic surface control for a class of strict-feedback nonlinear systems with parametric uncertainties, where a novel technique coined composite learning is developed to guarantee parameter convergence without the PE condition. In the composite learning, online recorded data together with instantaneous data are applied to generate prediction errors, and both tracking errors and prediction errors are utilized to update parametric estimates. The proposed approach is also extended to an output-feedback case by using a nonlinear separation principle. The distinctive feature of the composite learning is that parameter convergence can be guaranteed by an interval-excitation condition which is much weaker than the PE condition such that the control performance can be improved from practical asymptotic stability to practical exponential stability. An illustrative example is used for verifying effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper considers a remote state estimation problem, where a sensor measures the state of a linear discrete-time system. The sensor has computational capability to implement a local Kalman filter. The sensor-to-estimator communications are scheduled intentionally over a finite time horizon to obtain a desirable tradeoff between the state estimation quality and the limited communication resources. Compared with the literature, we adopt a Gaussianity-preserving event-based sensor schedule bypassing the nonlinearity problem met in threshold event-based polices. We derive the closed-form of minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimator and show that, if communication is triggered, the estimator cannot do better than the local Kalman filter, otherwise, the associated error covariance, is simply a sum of the estimation error of the local Kalman filter and the performance loss due to the absence of communication. We further design the scheduler’s parameters by solving a dynamic programming (DP) problem. The computational overhead of the \{DP\} problem is less sensitive to the system dimension compared with that of existing algorithms in the literature.},

The jump conditions depend on the plant output and on extra states incorporated in the observer that evolve according to some suitable combination of the output error and of its integral.

Suppose each agent updates its own state using a weighted sum of its neighbor's relative states with possibly negative weights. Then the affine control problem can be solved for either undirected or directed interaction graphs. It is shown in this paper that an affine formation is stabilizable over an undirected graph if and only if the undirected graph is universally rigid, while an affine formation is stabilizable over a directed graph in the  d -dimensional space if and only if the directed graph is  (d + 1) -rooted. Rigorous analysis is provided, mainly relying on Laplacian associated with the interaction graph, which contain both positive and negative weights.},

In particular, networks of identical passive subsystems, which are coupled according to a tree topology, are considered. For such networked systems, reduction is performed by clustering subsystems that show similar behavior and subsequently aggregating their states, leading to a reduced-order networked system that allows for an insightful physical interpretation. The clusters are chosen on the basis of the analysis of controllability and observability properties of associated edge systems, representing the importance of the couplings and providing a measure of the similarity of the behavior of neighboring subsystems. This reduction procedure is shown to preserve synchronization properties (i.e., the convergence of the subsystem trajectories to each other) and allows for the a priori computation of a bound on the reduction error with respect to external inputs and outputs.

With a proper choice of the equivalent part of the control, the resulting controller is shown to be Lyapunov stable with finite-time convergence of the sliding variable to 0. The convergence of the control input, as the sampling period goes to 0, to the continuous-time one is shown. The robustness with respect to matching perturbations is also investigated. The discretization performance in terms of the error order is studied for different discretizations of the equivalent part of the input.

This then induces a corresponding set of Youla–Kucera parameters. Previous work has shown that quadratic invariance of the controller set implies that the set of Youla–Kucera parameters is convex. In this technical note, we prove the converse. We thereby show that the only decentralized control problems for which the set of Youla–Kucera parameters is convex are those which are quadratically invariant. We further show that under additional assumptions, quadratic invariance is necessary and sufficient for the set of achievable closed-loop maps to be convex. We give two versions of our results. The first applies to bounded linear operators on a Banach space and the second applies to (possibly unstable) causal LTI systems in discrete or continuous time.},

  abstract = {Event-triggered approach to networked control systems is used to reduce the workload of the communication network. For the static output-feedback continuous event-trigger may generate an infinite number of sampling instants in finite time (Zeno phenomenon) what makes it inapplicable to the real-world systems. Periodic event-trigger avoids this behavior but does not use all the available information. In the present paper we aim to exploit the advantage of the continuous-time measurements and guarantee a positive lower bound on the inter-event times by introducing a switching approach for finding a waiting time in the event-triggered mechanism. Namely, our idea is to present the closed-loop system as a switching between the system under periodic sampling and the one under continuous event-trigger and take the maximum sampling preserving the stability as the waiting time. We extend this idea to the  L_{2} -gain and ISS analysis of perturbed networked control systems with network-induced delays. By examples we demonstrate that the switching approach to event-triggered control can essentially reduce the amount of measurements to be sent through a communication network compared to the existing methods.},

However this field was not intensively investigated later. For instance, the breakthrough result on unavoidable peaking effect for systems with strong damping factor was obtained by Izmailov in 1987, but it did not attract much attention. We try to continue this line of research and provide explicit worst-case lower bound. Then we exhibit large deviation effects for other pole locations and estimate lower bounds for them. The upper bounds for deviations of trajectories are much better studied; to obtain the smallest deviations by static linear feedback the techniques of linear matrix inequalities can be exploited. We demonstrate that for such closed-loop systems the upper and lower bounds have the same asymptotic behavior. },

For the class of optimal formation problems where the objective is to maximize coverage, we show that the optimal formation is a tree which can be efficiently constructed without solving a MINLP. In a mission space constrained by obstacles, we separate the formation process into intervals with no obstacles detected and intervals where one or more obstacles are detected. In the latter case, we propose a minimum-effort reconfiguration approach for the formation which still optimizes the objective function while avoiding the obstacles and ensuring connectivity. We include simulation results illustrating this dynamic formation process. },

In these control schemes all the agents use a model of their neighbourhood in order to generate triggering instants in which the local controller is updated and, if needed, local information based on the adopted control input is broadcasted to neighbouring agents. Synchronization of the network is proved and the existence of Zeno behaviour is excluded; an event-triggered strategy able to guarantee the existence of a minimum lower bound between inter-event times for broadcasted information and for control signal updating is proposed, thus allowing applications where both the communication bandwidth and the maximum updating frequency of actuators are critical. This idea is further extended in an asynchronous periodic event-triggered schemes where the agents check a trigger condition via a periodic distributed communication without requiring a model based computation. },

In this paper, a generic distance function is designed that can be used for this purpose. The so-called “peaking phenomenon”, which occurs when using the Euclidean distance to compare two hybrid trajectories, is circumvented by taking the hybrid nature of the system explicitly into account. Based on the proposed distance function, we define the stability of a trajectory and present sufficient Lyapunov-type conditions for hybrid system with state-triggered jumps. A constructive Lyapunov function design is presented for hybrid systems with affine flow and jump maps and a jump set that is a hyperplane. The stability conditions can then be verified using linear matrix conditions. Finally, for this class of systems, we present a tracking controller that asymptotically stabilises a given hybrid reference trajectory and we illustrate our results with an example.},

In particular, given known bounds on disturbance torques and uncertainties in the spacecraft inertia matrix, non-conservative ultimate bounds were obtained for the attitude tracking error assuming that the attitude and angular velocity are measured with known bounds on the measurement errors. In this paper, these results are extended to the case where the attitude and angular velocity are not measured, but estimated using an observer. Specifically, it is shown that given any attitude and angular velocity observer with known ultimate bounds on the estimation errors, the previously developed expressions for the ultimate bounds on the tracking error remain valid with observer-based control, provided the ultimate bounds on the estimation errors are used in place of the previously fixed bounds on the measurement errors. A numerical example of attitude tracking using a gyro and a single vector measurement demonstrates the utility of the proposed technique.},

The proposed ASMC uses a new adaptive law to achieve good tracking performance with small chattering effect. The new adaptive law considers an arbitrarily small vicinity of the sliding manifold, in which the derivatives of the adaptive gains are inversely proportional to the sliding variables. Such an adaptive law provides remarkably fast adaptation and chattering reduction near the sliding manifold. To yield the desirable closed-loop poles and simplify a complicated system model by adapting feedback compensation, the proposed ASMC scheme works together with a pole-placement control (PPC) and a TDE technique. It is shown that the tracking errors of the proposed ASMC scheme are guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) with arbitrarily small bound. The practical effectiveness and the fast adaptation of the proposed ASMC are illustrated in simulations and experiments with robot manipulators, and compared with those of an existing ASMC.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the active fault-tolerant control (FTC) problem for nonidentical high-order multi-agent systems, in the presence of actuator faults and network disconnections. The follower agents are enabled to track the output of a leader agent in faulty cases, by performing output feedback actuator fault compensations and distributed accommodations of network disconnections. In view of nonidentical nonlinearities, a high-gain observer like-protocol and a cooperative FTC controller are presented, with a synchronization condition to govern the global behavior in undirected/directed graphs. To distributively achieve the synchronization condition by updating local controller parameters, two broadcast mechanisms are presented on a spanning tree (for undirected graphs) and a cycle containing all nodes (for directed graphs). To ensure the tolerance to disconnections, the proposed broadcast mechanisms are redesigned by adding redundant information flows on spanning trees (for undirected graphs) and cycles containing all nodes (for directed graphs).},

The method can be seen as a non-trivial extension of the Krylov subspace methods for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. The procedure is based on the so called “nice selections,” which represent a choice of basis in the reachability or observability space of the LSS. The framework can also be used for exact matching of the input-output behavior of an LSS with a reduced order LSS for a specific switching sequence. Conditions for applicability of the method for model reduction are stated and finally the results are illustrated on numerical examples.},

Even in the absence of rudder input, the ground track and heading angles are not equal, due to the ever presence of wind. Wind is an important factor in MAV operations due to the inescapable fact that the MAV’s low airspeed is comparable to the prevailing wind speed. As a result, large drift angles develop. The estimation of wind is important for accurate navigation, and more so if the MAV’s sensor footprint must be steered toward, and cover, a specified target on the ground. In this paper, concepts of operation are developed and algorithms are designed s.t. the best possible real time estimates of aircraft heading and wind velocity & wind direction are obtained from the available GPS, inertial, and air data measurements.},

Assuming that measurements of airspeed and attitude of an UAV are available as inputs, a linear 4th order time-varying model of the UAV's longitudinal speed and the 3-D wind velocity is used to design a Kalman-filter driven by a GNSS velocity measurement airspeed sensor. An observability analysis shows that the states can be estimated along with an airspeed sensor calibration factor provided that the flight maneuvers are persistently exciting, i.e. the aircraft changes attitude. The theoretical analysis of the KF shows that global exponential stability of the estimation error is achieved under these conditions. The method is tested using experimental data from three different UAVs, using their legacy autopilot to provide basic estimates of UAV velocity and attitude. The results show that convergent estimates are achieved with typical flight patterns indicating that excitation resulting from the environment and normal flight operation is sufficient. Wind velocity estimates correlate well with observed winds at the ground. The validation of AOA and SSA estimates is preliminary, but indicate some degree of correlation between the AOA estimate and vertical accelerometer measurements, as would be expected since lift force can be modeled as a linear function of AOA in normal flight.},

To identify the unknown inertial matrix included in the attitude dynamic model, this paper proposes a new structural identifier that differs from those previously proposed in that it additionally contains a neural networks (NNs) mechanism and a robust adaptive mechanism, respectively. Using the NNs to compensate the unknown aerodynamic forces online and the robust adaptive mechanism to cancel the combination of the overlarge NNs compensation error and the external disturbances, the new robust neural identifier exhibits a better identification performance in the complex flight environment. Moreover, an optimized algorithm is included in the NNs mechanism to alleviate the burdensome online computation. By the strict Lyapunov argument, the asymptotic convergence of the inertial matrix identification error, position tracking error, and attitude tracking error to arbitrarily small neighborhood of the origin is proved. The simulation and implementation results are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed controller.},

Then, a novel smooth function is introduced in the control law to eliminate the effect of quantization based on the intermediate control law constructed in the first step.

  abstract = {Air motors are increasingly being used in pneumatic related industries because of their advantages of low operating cost and low maintenance. The \{DSP\} controller and the backstepping sliding mode control method were utilized in this study to control an X – Y pneumatic table for tracking trajectory. Due to the effects of the compressibility of air, friction between the motor and ball screw table and the dead-zone effect caused by the proportional valve, the system will yield different responses even with the same inlet pressure and will chatter at low speed. Hence under certain conditions, this method of backstepping sliding mode control can be applied to achieve better results than with the \{PID\} controller, such as for tracking circle error and tracking error of the two axes. According to the results, a steady-state error of 0.5 μm can be achieved. The proposed method of backstepping sliding mode control can accomplish accurate tracking circle trajectory performance, offering an improvement in the tracking error of more than 50% over that of the \{PID\} controller. },

Then, a simple sigmoid neural network is employed to approximate the uncertain parts including saturation in the system. By combing the backstepping technique and the sliding-mode control, virtual controls are designed in each step. With the proposed scheme, no prior knowledge is required on the bound of input saturation, and comparative simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {The Kalman filter is a powerful state estimator and has been successfully applied in many fields. To guarantee the optimality of the Kalman filter, the noise covariances need to be exactly known. However, this is not necessarily true in many practical applications. Usually, they are either completely unknown or at most partially known. In this technical note, we study performance of the Kalman filter with mismatched process and measurement noise covariances. For this purpose, three mean squared errors (MSEs) are used, namely the ideal MSE (IMSE), the filter calculated MSE (FMSE), and the true MSE (TMSE). The main contribution of this work is that the relationships between the three MSEs are disclosed from two points of views. The first view is about their ordering and the second view is about the relative closeness from the FMSE and TMSE to the IMSE. Using the first view, it is found that for the case with positive (definite) deviation from the truth, the FMSE is the worst and the IMSE is the best. And for the case with negative (definite) deviation, the TMSE is the worst and the best is the FMSE. Using the second view, it is found that the TMSE is relatively closer to the IMSE than the FMSE if the deviation is larger than certain threshold, and the TMSE will be farther away otherwise. Numerical examples further verify these conclusions.},

The first one is a linear descriptor reduced-order observer, which generates the exact estimation of state and sensor faults together with disturbances by decoupling them from the state vector without any supplementary design. The second one refers to a descriptor sliding mode observer approach, where the state, disturbances, sensor and actuator faults can be reconstructed simultaneously. In the second method, the reachability of sliding surface is not necessary to be investigated, since the actuator faults can be estimated directly without using the equivalent output error injection scheme as in traditional sliding mode observers. Therefore, both developed observer approaches avoid the sliding surface switching problem of traditional sliding mode observers in application to switched systems. Finally, an example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the two designed observer methods. },

It is often hard to find the global solution of this optimization problem because in most cases both the corresponding objective function and the search space are nonconvex. The difficulty in solving the optimization problem depends mainly on the experimental conditions, more specifically on the spectra of the input/output data collected from the system. It is therefore possible to improve the convergence of the algorithms by properly choosing the data prefilters; in this paper we show how to perform this choice. We present the application of the proposed approach to case studies where the standard algorithms tend to fail to converge to the global minimum. },

The first algorithm is optimal in the sense of minimum mean-square error, which is obtained based on the measurement differencing method, Bayes’ rule and some results derived in this paper. The second algorithm is a suboptimal algorithm obtained by using a lot of Gaussian hypotheses.

  pages    = {32 - 40},
  abstract = {Abstract In this paper, the regularity and stability analysis of discrete-time Markov jump linear singular systems (MJLSS) is performed. When dealing with singular systems, a primary concern is related to the existence and uniqueness of a solution to the system. This problem, that is called regularity problem, has a known solution when the linear singular system is not subject to jumps (LSS). It turns out that when the pair of matrices that describes the dynamics of the \{LSS\} satisfies a certain condition, then it is regular. By extending this condition to MJLSS, a unique solution for this class of systems is derived. Indeed through the idea of mode-to-mode regularity, which is stronger than the mode-by-mode notion that can be found in the literature, the existence of a unique solution of an \{MJLSS\} is shown. Furthermore, for systems that are mode-to-mode regular, it is shown how to obtain recursive second moment models whose complexity depends on how anticipative the systems is. The derived results on regularity and second moment modeling enable us to study stability of an MJLSS. By following the literature on Markov jump linear systems (MJLS), four different concepts of stability are introduced and their relationship is established. The results presented in this paper generalize well known results concerning the stability given in the \{MJLS\} theory. For instance, it is shown that the stability of the system is equivalent to the spectral radius of an augmented matrix being less than one, as happens in the theory of MJLS. },

  abstract = {Abstract This paper investigates the path following control problem for an unmanned airship in the presence of unknown wind and uncertainties. The backstepping technique augmented by a robust adaptive radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is employed as the main control framework. Based on the horizontal dynamic model of the airship, an improved adaptive integral line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law is first proposed, which suits any parametric paths. The guidance law calculates the desired yaw angle and estimates the wind. Then the controller is extended to cope with the airship yaw tracking and velocity control by resorting to the augmented backstepping technique. The uncertainties of the dynamics are compensated by using the robust RBFNNs. Each robust \{RBFNN\} utilizes an nth-order smooth switching function to combine a conventional \{RBFNN\} with a robust control. The conventional \{RBFNN\} dominates in the neural active region, while the robust control retrieves the transient outside the active region, so that the stability range can be widened. Stability analysis shows that the controlled closed-loop system is globally uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulations are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach. },

The primary objective of the allocation is to minimize torque error and improve performance when the system saturates or becomes singular. As a secondary objective, internal bearing and gear friction are exploited to reduce power usage without the need for accurate friction models. The algorithm exploits the fact that redundant control moment gyroscopes (CMGs) and the rotors of reaction wheel assemblies (RWAs) have nonsingleton minimum torque error solutions. Thus, friction in the rotors and gimbals of the CMG and RWA can be used to find a minimum power solution among the set of minimum torque error solutions. The convex optimization framework enables real-time implementable algorithms, which fully utilize control authority without requiring tuning for changes in the number or the configuration of actuators.},

Model uncertainty generally degrades the performance of conventional learning algorithms. To deal with this problem, a robust worst-case norm-optimal ILC design is introduced. The design problem is reformulated as a convex optimization problem, which can be solved efficiently. The technical note also shows that the proposed robust ILC is equivalent to conventional norm-optimal ILC with trial-varying parameters; accordingly, the design tradeoff between robustness and convergence speed is analyzed.},

  abstract  = {Blimps are a promising platform for aerial robotics and have been studied extensively for this purpose. Unlike other aerial vehicles, blimps are relatively safe and also possess the ability to loiter for long periods. These advantages, however, have been difficult to exploit because blimp dynamics are complex and inherently non-linear. The classical approach to system modeling represents the system as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) based on Newtonian principles. A more recent modeling approach is based on representing state transitions as a Gaussian process (GP). In this paper, we present a general technique for system identification that combines these two modeling approaches into a single formulation. This is done by training a Gaussian process on the residual between the non-linear model and ground truth training data. The result is a GP-enhanced model that provides an estimate of uncertainty in addition to giving better state predictions than either ODE or GP alone. We show how the GP-enhanced model can be used in conjunction with reinforcement learning to generate a blimp controller that is superior to those learned with ODE or GP models alone.},

Instead of considering Spam filtering as a standard classification problem, we highlight the importance of considering specific characteristics of the problem, especially concept drift, in designing new filters. Two particularly important aspects not widely recognized in the literature are discussed: the difficulties in updating a classifier based on the bag-of-words representation and a major difference between two early naive Bayes models. Overall, we conclude that while important advancements have been made in the last years, several aspects remain to be explored, especially under more realistic evaluation settings.},

The control objective is to reach the desired waypoints, with a desired surge. Here, the surge controller is designed with an integrator backstepping control that takes the propeller model and the motor model into account. In order to generate a realistic trajectory between two consecutive waypoints, the guidance system takes into consideration the torpedo's dynamics and kinematics. The numerical simulations in the presence of marine current and of torpedo's parameters uncertainties show the robustness of the MIMO backstepping control loop associated with the acceleration feedback loop. In the same time, the generation of a realist trajectory, generated from the torpedo's hydrodynamic model, assures a feasible trajectory tracking. The implementation of a MIMO backstepping control with acceleration feedback, and of an integrator backstepping control in a heavyweight torpedo of type F17 mod2, designed by DCN Armes sous-marines, is the main contribution of this work},

Based on a practical ship, the damping force should be nonlinear which related with velocity. The solution consists of a Lyapunov-based trajectory tracking control law and disturbance estimator. The controller solves the boundedness and convergence of position tracking error, which should be approaching to equilibrium states. The estimator calculates an unknown current under an assumption that the disturbance force is constant. Regarding to a practical boat, we demonstrate how Lyapunov based techniques yield a control structure that i) works against unknown current disturbance, i) considers the saturation influence on position error and iii) computes the nonlinear damping force, torque.},

The purpose of this paper is to develop a model for airship conceptual design and help provide insight into the viability of high‐altitude/long‐endurance airships.Design/methodology/approach – A configuration analysis model with the consideration of pressure difference, temperature difference, and helium purity, etc. was developed. The influences of the airship payload, size and area required of solar cell with environment and operation parameters, such as operation latitude, pressure difference, temperature difference, helium purity, seasons, latitude, and wind speed, etc. were analyzed.Findings – The results show that the area of solar cell required for stratospheric airship is very large under the condition of low altitude, high latitude, wind, and in winter, etc. which might make the design of high‐altitude/long‐endurance airship an elusive goal. They also show that the solar cell efficiency is the key technology in the control of solar cell area required for airships, and the technology advances in regenerative fuel cells and propeller efficiency have significant effects among on the airship payload, size, and solar cell area required for airship.Originality/value – The paper analyses the energy balance of the high‐altitude/long‐endurance airship. }

An off-policy learning method is developed to learn the H∞ control policy from real system data rather than the mathematical model. First, Karhunen-Loève decomposition is used to compute the empirical eigenfunctions, which are then employed to derive a reduced-order model (ROM) of slow subsystem based on the singular perturbation theory. The H∞ control problem is reformulated based on the ROM, which can be transformed to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation, theoretically. To learn the solution of the HJI equation from real system data, a data-driven off-policy learning approach is proposed based on the simultaneous policy update algorithm and its convergence is proved. For implementation purpose, a neural network (NN)- based action-critic structure is developed, where a critic NN and two action NNs are employed to approximate the value function, control, and disturbance policies, respectively. Subsequently, a least-square NN weight-tuning rule is derived with the method of weighted residuals. Finally, the developed data-driven off-policy learning approach is applied to a nonlinear diffusion-reaction process, and the obtained results demonstrate its effectiveness.},

The proposed control law is designed using the adaptive backstepping method and with few model aerodynamics parameters besides the qualitative physical properties. The resulting feedback controller is able to follow the given references in three Cartesian positions (x,y,z) and yaw angle by actuating four thrusters and their deflection angles. Lyapunov function analysis is introduced to compensate for the engine physical limits and guarantees closed-loop system stability. A degraded scenario (wind disturbance) which renders the airship statically unstable is also considered to show the adaptation capabilities of the control law. The simulations are carried out using a realistic multi-vectored thrust stratospheric airship model that is also developed in this study. Simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive backstepping control when saturations are present even in wind disturbance.},

  abstract = { A stratospheric airship is an airship flying at a high altitude of 20 km as a stratospheric platform. Due to the low atmospheric density and flight speed, the efficiency of a conventional actuator, such as an aerodynamic control surface, is decreased. Thus, a new multi-vectored thrust airship called a flat peach is discussed in this paper. This article describes the derivation, design and simulation implementation of a non-linear controller for an airship with multi-vector thrust. The controller is designed using a command-filtered, vector backstepping approach, and can set the airship track three Cartesian positions (x,y,z) and yaw angle to their desired values and stabilize the pitch and roll angles. The controller is non-linear to address the kinematics and airship dynamics. The approach guarantees exponential stability of a compensated tracking error in the sense of Lyapunov. Both the stability analysis and simulation results are included. },

  abstract  = {A model-free control strategy based on reinforcement learning algorithm is investigated for stratospheric airship. Firstly, an adaptive method of discretizing airship state space is proposed after analyzing its motions, through which the MDP(Markov Decision Process) model of control is established on the foundation of actual motions. Then, to save computing time and avoid being trapped in “curse of dimensionality”, data of actual actions online is collected as reference for virtual actions, and control input is worked out by learning from virtual actions offline. Finally, simulations of stratospheric airship's common tasks like hovering and path tracking are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control strategy. Results show that the control strategy works well without access to airship accurate dynamic model. The algorithm's computational efficiency and convergence can meet requirements of practical application, and the precision makes it suitable for tasks like reconnaissance and communication. Control results get better in limited constant wind than windless conditions.},

These flying objects lighter than air (L.T.A.) are assumed to undergo large rigid-body motion and small elastic deformation. The formalism used is based on the Euler--Lagrange approach. The airship considered in this study is represented by a flexible ellipsoid of revolution. The coupling between the added masses issued from the overall body motion and those issued from the elasticity was determined by means of the velocity potential flow theory. We develop a fully analytical methodology with some assumptions. This feature distinguishes the current work from earlier treatments of the coupling, it allows one to minimise the number of degrees of freedom of the dynamical model, and renders the model suitable for use in the algorithms of stabilisation and trajectory generation. Numerical simulations are presented at the end of this paper. They underline the interest of the developed theoretical results.},

  abstract = {The aeroelastic derivatives for today's aircraft are calculated in the concept phase using a standard procedure. This scheme has to be extended for large airships, due to various nonlinearities in structural and aerodynamic behaviour. In general, the structural model of an airship is physically as well as geometrically nonlinear. The main sources of nonlinearity are large deformations and the nonlinear material behaviour of membranes. The aerodynamic solution is also included in the nonlinear problem, because the deformed airship influences the surrounding flow. Due to these nonlinearities, the aeroelastic problem for airships can only be solved by an iterative procedure. As one possibility, the coupled aerodynamic and structural dynamic problem was handled using linked standard solvers. On the structural side, the Finite-Element program package \{ABAQUS\} was extended with an interface to the aerodynamic solver VSAERO. \{VSAERO\} is based on the aerodynamic panel method using potential flow theory. The equilibrium of the internal structural and the external aerodynamic forces leads to the structural response and a trimmed flight state for the specified flight conditions (e.g. speed, altitude). The application of small perturbations around a trimmed state produces reaction forces and moments. These constraint forces are then transferred into translational and rotational acceleration fields by performing an inertia relief analysis of the disturbed structural model. The change between the trimmed flight state and the disturbed one yields the respective aeroelastic derivatives. By including the calculated derivatives in the linearised equation of motion system, it is possible to judge the stability and controllability of the investigated airship. },

  abstract = {In recent years, the study of semi-rigid airship has revived with the development of airships. Semi-rigid airships have some characteristics of rigid airships and non-rigid airships. Due to the flexibility of the envelope of the non-rigid airship, the variation of the temperature of the inner gas will lead to its structure deformation and affect its flight altitude. This paper develops the structural mechanics model, thermodynamic model and dynamic model of the semi-rigid airship, based on which nonlinear finite element analysis is employed for geometrically nonlinear deformation of the airship upper film in consideration of thermodynamics and structural mechanics coupling. Based on the thermal-structural interaction, the thermal characteristics and flight performances of the airship during floating flight are investigated. The 3-D solar radiation and temperature distribution of the airship skin and the temperature variation of the inner gas are presented to investigate the thermal performance of the airship, flight velocity, acceleration and flight altitude are simulated to investigate the flight performance, and the variations of the volume and pressure difference of the inner gas are calculated to provide a basis for structure design. The results of the simulation can be referenced for the design of the semi-rigid airship, and can be used for the further study on the attitude control of the airship during its floating flight. },

A backstepping methodology is adopted as a design tool, since it is suitable for the cascaded nature of the vehicle dynamics. It also offers design flexibility and robustness against parametric uncertainties which are often encountered in aerodynamic modeling and air stream disturbances. Indeed, in our simulations we assume a 10% error in all dynamic parameters and yet the controller performs position, orientation, linear and angular velocities tracking successfully. We also impose an additional air stream disturbance and the controller corrects the vehicle's trajectory successfully too.},

Based on Lyapunov theory and genetic algorithms (GA), a reliable impulsive controller design approach is proposed. With the obtained controller, the autonomous spacecraft rendezvous is accomplished by a series of proper impulse thrust in spite of the orbital uncertainty and the possible thruster faults.

Generally, the number of thrusters in an \{AUV\} is more than what is minimally required to produce the desired motion. We investigate how to exploit the excess number of thrusters to accommodate thruster faults during operation. First, a redundancy resolution scheme is presented that takes into account the presence of excess number of thrusters along with any thruster faults and determines the reference thruster forces to produce the desired motion. These reference thruster forces are utilized in the controller to generate the required motion. This approach resolves the thruster redundancy in the Cartesian space and allows the \{AUV\} to track the task-space trajectories with asymptotic reduction of the task-space errors. Results from computer simulations are presented to demonstrate the viability of the proposed scheme.},

abstract={This technical note proposes a robust iterative learning control (ILC) strategy to regulate iteratively-operated, finite-duration nonrepetitive systems characterized by iteration-varying uncertainties in initial states, external disturbances, plant model matrices and desired reference trajectories. Our convergence analysis exploits results on input-to-state stability of discrete parameterized systems. For a class of multiple-input, multiple-output discrete-time linear systems, with all iteration-varying uncertainties bounded, we give one condition that ensures boundedness of all system trajectories and an additional, second condition that ensures convergence of tracking error. Notably, we do not require the standard ILC contraction mapping requirement to hold at each iteration. Moreover, we show that it is possible to achieve perfect output tracking if the iteration-varying uncertainties all converge with increasing iteration.},

However, the general PF always suffers from the particle impoverishment problem, which can lead to the misleading state estimation results. To cope with this problem, a modified particle filter, i.e., intelligent particle filter (IPF), is proposed in this paper. It is inspired from the genetic algorithm. The particle impoverishment in general PF mainly results from the poverty of particle diversity. In IPF, the genetic-operators-based strategy is designed to further improve the particle diversity. It should be pointed out that the general PF is a special case of the proposed IPF with the specified parameters. Two experiment examples show that IPF mitigates particle impoverishment and provides more accurate state estimation results compared with the general PF. Finally, the proposed IPF is implemented for real-time fault detection on a three-tank system, and the results are satisfactory.},

A robust approach to \{FDI\} residual generator design is described to realise a diagnostic scheme for the satellite system, focused on a “thruster modulation” problem. The approach taken is based on both state estimation of an accurate linear model for the satellite system and unknown input de-coupling to achieve robust \{FDI\} in the presence of severe dynamic uncertainty during main engine deployment. A brief description of the satellite structure is outlined in order to highlight the main sources of uncertainty and disturbance affecting the monitored system. The satellite nominal and faulty conditions are simulated by means of an industry standard non-linear model implementation in the MATLAB® and SIMULINK® environments. A comparison with the existing fault diagnosis scheme implemented on board the \{MEX\} is also reported. Suitable performance criteria are introduced together with Monte Carlo analysis for both design tuning and assessing the robustness and performance evaluation of the complete \{FDI\} design strategy. },

A new method for computing the probability of a fault given multiple different types of residuals processors is presented. The method uses the Shiryayev sequential probability ratio test to estimate the probability of the presence of a fault signal given the residuals generated from either parity relationships or fault detection filters, a fault map of the impact of each fault signal on the residuals, and an adaptive fault estimation scheme that enables processing with fewer residuals. This new methodology is applied to the detection of the fault signals in the attitude control system and navigation system of deep space satellites. First a sensor fusion process is presented for blending star tracker data, gyro data, accelerometer data, and information from the vehicle control system to form the best estimate of the navigation state. Then a set of fault detection filters are developed that detect and uniquely identify faults in each of the sensors or actuators. Decision-making is handled through the sequential processing. Simulation results for a single-satellite system are presented.},

  abstract = {This paper analyses multivariate statistical techniques for identifying and isolating abnormal process behaviour. These techniques include contribution charts and variable reconstructions that relate to the application of principal component analysis (PCA). The analysis reveals firstly that contribution charts produce variable contributions which are linearly dependent and may lead to an incorrect diagnosis, if the number of principal components retained is close to the number of recorded process variables. The analysis secondly yields that variable reconstruction affects the geometry of the \{PCA\} decomposition. The paper further introduces an improved variable reconstruction method for identifying multiple sensor and process faults and for isolating their influence upon the recorded process variables. It is shown that this can accommodate the effect of reconstruction, i.e. changes in the covariance matrix of the sensor readings and correctly re-defining the PCA-based monitoring statistics and their confidence limits. },

  abstract = {In this paper, a novel data-driven model-free adaptive predictive control method based on lazy learning technique is proposed for a class of discrete-time single-input and single-output nonlinear systems. The feature of the proposed approach is that the controller is designed only using the input-output (I/O) measurement data of the system by means of a novel dynamic linearization technique with a new concept termed pseudogradient (PG). Moreover, the predictive function is implemented in the controller using a lazy-learning (LL)-based PG predictive algorithm, such that the controller not only shows good robustness but also can realize the effect of model-free adaptive prediction for the sudden change of the desired signal. Further, since the LL technique has the characteristic of database queries, both the online and offline I/O measurement data are fully and simultaneously utilized to real-time adjust the controller parameters during the control process. Moreover, the stability of the proposed method is guaranteed by rigorous mathematical analysis. Meanwhile, the numerical simulations and the laboratory experiments implemented on a practical three-tank water level control system both verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Such a control formula tion yields a controller that suppresses disturbances and tracks desired trajectories uniformly in all configurations of the manipulator. Use of a poor dynamic model with this kind of model-based decoupling and linearizing scheme, however, may result in performance that is inferior to a much simpler, fixed-gain scheme.In this paper, we develop a parameter-adaptive control scheme in a set of adaptive laws that can be added to the nonlinear, model-based controller. The scheme is unique be cause it is designed specifically for the nonlinear, model- based controller and has been proven stable in a full, nonlin ear setting. After adaptation, the error dynamics of the joints are decoupled with uniform disturbance rejection in all ma nipulator configurations. The issues of sufficient excitation and the effect of disturbances are also discussed.The theory is demonstrated with simulation results and also with data from an implementation for an industrial robot, the Adept One. },

In the absence of failures and unpredictable changes, the controller of [1] which is based on gain scheduling performs very well and exhibits a good degree of robustness even for high angles of attack However, in the presence of failures its performance deteriorates severly. In order to accommodate possible failures and therefore maintain the good performance characteristics of the aircraft, the control system [1] is augmented with a hybrid adaptive linear quadratic control scheme. The augmented adaptive flight control system has now the capability of learning and accommodating on line any drastic changes in the aircraft dynamics due to surface or hardware failure. The proposed flight control system is tested on the nonlinear model of the F-16 aircraft given in [1] and the simulation results demonstrate its ability to accommodate control failures and maintain good performance.},

This paper presents a dynamic data-driven approach to accurately detect precursors to the combustion instability phenomena. In particular, grey-scale images of combustion flames have been used in combination with pressure time-series data for information fusion to detect and predict flame instabilities in the combustion process. These grey-scale images are analyzed using deep belief network (DBN). The cross-dependencies between the features extracted by the DBN and the symbolic sequences generated from pressure time-series are then analyzed using ×D-Markov (pronounced cross D-Markov) models that are constructed by a combination of state-splitting and cross-entropy rate; this leads to the development of a variable-memory cross-model as a representation of the underlying physical process. These cross-models are then used for detection and prediction of combustion instability phenomena. The proposed concept is validated on experimental data collected from a laboratory-scale swirl-stabilized combustor apparatus, where the instability phenomena are induced by typical protocols leading to unstable flames.},

This assumption is likely to be violated in practical settings as new fault types can emerge over time.

We explored how to leverage strengths of unsupervised and supervised approaches to build a model capable of detecting faults even if none are still observed, and of improving over time, as new fault types are observed.

  abstract = {The state prediction based on the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) for nonlinear stochastic discrete-time systems with linear measurement equation is investigated. Predicting future states by using the information of available measurements is an effective method to solve time delay problems. It not only helps the system operator to perform security analysis, but also allows more time for operator to take better decision in case of emergency. In addition, predictive state can make the system implement real-time monitoring and achieve good robustness. UKF has been popular in state prediction because of its advantages in handling nonlinear systems. However, the accuracy of prediction degrades notably once a filter uses a much longer future prediction. A confidence interval (CI) is proposed to overcome the problem. The advantages of CI are that it provides the information about states coverage, which is useful for treatment-plan evaluation, and it can be directly used to specify the margin to accommodate prediction errors. Meanwhile, the CI of prediction errors can be used to correct the predictive state, and thereby it improves the prediction accuracy. Simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

  abstract = {In this study, the authors focus on hidden Markov model (HMM) parameters estimation with independent multiple observations and non-linear inequality constraints. The parameters estimation process is divided into four steps: initialisation, parameters pre-estimation, parameters re-estimation and termination. The pre-estimation results are used to approximate non-linear inequality constraints to linear inequality constraints. In parameters re-estimation step, the active-set optimisation is combined with the expectation maximisation (EM) algorithm in M-step and the active set-based EM algorithm is proposed to re-estimate HMM parameters when inequality constraints are not satisfied in pre-estimation. An auxiliary function is devised for reconstructing the optimisation objective function and the convergence of the proposed algorithm is also demonstrated. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm provides better performance by modifying the random error of observation data appropriately and it is powerful for industry process fault diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Recently, the well-known k-nearest neighbor (kNN) rule has been successfully applied to the fault detection of industrial processes with nonlinear, multimode, and non-Gaussian distributed data. Once a fault is detected, how to investigate the root causes of the fault by isolating the true faulty variables without any historical fault information is a challenging problem. Inspired by the idea of the contribution analysis (CA) methods developed in the frame of the principal component analysis (PCA), in this paper, a novel isolation index will be provided by decomposing the kNN distance used as the detection index in kNN-based fault detection method. The commonly used CA-based isolation methods suffer from smearing effect due to the correlation among the defined isolation indices, thus prone to misdiagnosis. The proposed isolation index is defined in the original measurement space without correlation. Moreover, theoretical analysis of the isolability for the proposed fault isolation method shows that it can isolate multiple sensor faults under a less strict condition than that used in the analysis of those CA-based fault isolation methods. The numerical examples and Tennessee Eastman (TE) benchmark process are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

However, the standard approach and its recent modifications still encounter some problems for fault diagnosis related to KPI of the underlying process. To cope with these difficulties, an improved PLS (IPLS) approach is presented in this paper. IPLS is able to decompose the measurable process variables into the KPI-related and unrelated parts, respectively. Based on it, the corresponding test statistics are designed to offer meaningful fault diagnosis information and thus, the corresponding maintenance actions can be further taken to ensure the desired performance of the systems. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a numerical example and Tennessee Eastman (TE) benchmark process are respectively utilized. It can be seen that the proposed approach shows satisfactory results not only for diagnosing KPI-related faults but also for its high fault detection rate.},

Two types of fault are considered: bearing and broken rotor bars faults. The proposed architecture is based on high-resolution spectral analysis techniques also known as subspace techniques. These frequency estimation techniques allow to separate frequency components including frequencies close to the fundamental one. These frequencies correspond to fault sensitive frequencies. Once frequencies are estimated, their corresponding amplitudes are obtained by using the least squares estimator. Then, a fault severity criterion is derived from the amplitude estimates. The proposed methods were tested using experimental stator current signals issued from two induction motors with the considered faults.

As a matter of fact, an FDD system is a data-processing system on the basis of information redundancy, in which the data and human's understanding of the data are two fundamental elements. Human's understanding may be an explicit input-output model representing the relationship among the system's variables. It may also be represented as knowledge implicitly (e.g., the connection weights of a neural network). Therefore, FDD is done through some kind of modeling, signal processing, and intelligence computation. In this paper, a variety of FDD techniques are reviewed within the unified data-processing framework to give a full picture of FDD and achieve a new level of understanding. According to the types of data and how the data are processed, the FDD methods are classified into three categories: model-based online data-driven methods, signal-based methods, and knowledge-based history data-driven methods. An outlook to the possible evolution of FDD in industrial automation, including the hybrid FDD and the emerging networked FDD, are also presented to reveal the future development direction in this field.},

  abstract      = {Fault detection and diagnosis is an important problem in process engineering. It is the central component of abnormal event management (AEM) which has attracted a lot of attention recently. \{AEM\} deals with the timely detection, diagnosis and correction of abnormal conditions of faults in a process. Early detection and diagnosis of process faults while the plant is still operating in a controllable region can help avoid abnormal event progression and reduce productivity loss. Since the petrochemical industries lose an estimated 20 billion dollars every year, they have rated \{AEM\} as their number one problem that needs to be solved. Hence, there is considerable interest in this field now from industrial practitioners as well as academic researchers, as opposed to a decade or so ago. There is an abundance of literature on process fault diagnosis ranging from analytical methods to artificial intelligence and statistical approaches. From a modelling perspective, there are methods that require accurate process models, semi-quantitative models, or qualitative models. At the other end of the spectrum, there are methods that do not assume any form of model information and rely only on historic process data. In addition, given the process knowledge, there are different search techniques that can be applied to perform diagnosis. Such a collection of bewildering array of methodologies and alternatives often poses a difficult challenge to any aspirant who is not a specialist in these techniques. Some of these ideas seem so far apart from one another that a non-expert researcher or practitioner is often left wondering about the suitability of a method for his or her diagnostic situation. While there have been some excellent reviews in this field in the past, they often focused on a particular branch, such as analytical models, of this broad discipline. The basic aim of this three part series of papers is to provide a systematic and comparative study of various diagnostic methods from different perspectives. We broadly classify fault diagnosis methods into three general categories and review them in three parts. They are quantitative model-based methods, qualitative model-based methods, and process history based methods. In the first part of the series, the problem of fault diagnosis is introduced and approaches based on quantitative models are reviewed. In the remaining two parts, methods based on qualitative models and process history data are reviewed. Furthermore, these disparate methods will be compared and evaluated based on a common set of criteria introduced in the first part of the series. We conclude the series with a discussion on the relationship of fault diagnosis to other process operations and on emerging trends such as hybrid blackboard-based frameworks for fault diagnosis.},

  abstract  = {Modern industrial system is becoming more and more complex in order to produce the goods with high quality or achieve the functional requirements set by human beings. However, once the faults occur in the system, it's highly possible that the financial losses and even the operators' death may be caused. Therefore, it's necessary to improve the reliability of the system. The data-based fault diagnosis scheme is an important approach to realize the fault-tolerant control to further secure the system operation in the normal condition. This paper concentrates on the multivariate statistical analyses included in the framework of data-based scheme, more specifically, Total Projection to Latent Structures (TPLS). Although the traditional TPLS has achieved effective monitoring results in some practical applications, it should be noted that the decomposition principle of process variables is not appropriate. Furthermore, the test statistic it chooses can not reflect the subspaces they monitored. Both of the weaknesses make TPLS useless in some circumstances. To solve the problems, this paper proposes a Modified TPLS (MTPLS) based on TPLS, statistics theory and matrix analysis. Compared with TPLS, MTPLS has better fault diagnosis performance. A numerical example is used to validate the effectiveness of TPLS.},

abstract={This paper investigates the distributed adaptive control problems for nonlinear vehicle-following systems subject to nonlinear acceleration uncertainties involving vehicle acceleration disturbances, wind gusts, and parameter uncertainties. It is worth mentioning that the acceleration of the leader in most existing studies is always assumed to be zero or constant; the evolution of the leader in this paper may be subject to some unknown bounded input. Distributed adaptive control strategies based on an integral sliding mode control (ISMC) technique are proposed to maintain a rigid formation for a string of vehicle platoon in one dimension. First, distributed adaptive control based on traditional constant time headway (TCTH) policy under the assumption that the initial spacing and velocity errors are zero is developed to guarantee that all spacing errors are uniformly ultimately bounded and that the string stability of the whole vehicle platoon is also satisfied. Then, a modified constant time headway (MCTH) policy is proposed to remove the assumption of zero initial spacing and velocity errors and simultaneously effectively decrease the intervehicle spacing (i.e., increase the traffic density), making them nearly equal to those by using the constant spacing (CS) policy. Adaptive compensation terms without requiring a prior knowledge of upper bounds of the uncertainties are constructed to compensate for the time-variant effects caused by nonlinear acceleration uncertainties. Finally, numerical simulation results show the validity and advantages of the proposed policy up to a significant higher traffic density.},

This technical note proposes an approach for data-driven filtering and control that combines the identification and the model-based design into one joint problem. The signal of interest is modeled as a missing part of a trajectory of the data generating system. Subsequently, the missing data estimation problem is reformulated as a mosaic-Hankel structured matrix low-rank approximation/completion problem. A local optimization method, based on the variable projections principle, is then used for its numerical solution. The missing data estimation approach and the solution method proposed are illustrated on filtering and smoothing examples.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the fault-tolerant control problem for an Internet-based three-tank system in the presence of possible sensor bias faults. The Internet-based three-tank system is an experimental setup that can be regarded as a typical networked system for evaluating networked fault-diagnosis and fault-tolerant control methods. Packet dropout phenomenon in the sensor-to-controller link is considered in this paper, and the fault type we deal with is chosen as the sensor bias fault. Fault-diagnosis unit is designed toward an auxiliary system. Sensor bias faults can be detected by comparing the residual signal generated by the fault detection filter and a prescribed threshold. After that, the fault can be isolated by using the residual analysis approach. Once the fault is isolated, it can be estimated iteratively in the least-squares sense. A fault accommodation method is proposed, and a fault-tolerant control strategy is achieved based on the fault information provided by the fault-diagnosis unit. The approach brought forward in this paper is demonstrated via an experimental study on the practical Internet-based three-tank system. Results show the effectiveness and the applicability of the proposed techniques.},

  abstract = {Abstract The control algorithm hierarchy of motion control for over-actuated mechanical systems with a redundant set of effectors and actuators commonly includes three levels. First, a high-level motion control algorithm commands a vector of virtual control efforts (i.e. forces and moments) in order to meet the overall motion control objectives. Second, a control allocation algorithm coordinates the different effectors such that they together produce the desired virtual control efforts, if possible. Third, low-level control algorithms may be used to control each individual effector via its actuators. Control allocation offers the advantage of a modular design where the high-level motion control algorithm can be designed without detailed knowledge about the effectors and actuators. Important issues such as input saturation and rate constraints, actuator and effector fault tolerance, and meeting secondary objectives such as power efficiency and tear-and-wear minimization are handled within the control allocation algorithm. The objective of the present paper is to survey control allocation algorithms, motivated by the rapidly growing range of applications that have expanded from the aerospace and maritime industries, where control allocation has its roots, to automotive, mechatronics, and other industries. The survey classifies the different algorithms according to two main classes based on the use of linear or nonlinear models, respectively. The presence of physical constraints (e.g input saturation and rate constraints), operational constraints and secondary objectives makes optimization-based design a powerful approach. The simplest formulations allow explicit solutions to be computed using numerical linear algebra in combination with some logic and engineering solutions, while the more challenging formulations with nonlinear models or complex constraints and objectives call for iterative numerical optimization procedures. Experiences using the different methods in aerospace, maritime, automotive and other application areas are discussed. The paper ends with some perspectives on new applications and theoretical challenges. },

However, further studies find that these methods gradually lose their functions when amplitudes of quality-unrelated faults increase; in addition, they still consume a relatively large amount of calculation load in practice. In this brief, we propose a new structure of preprocessing-modeling-postprocessing, within which modified orthogonal projections to latent structures (MOPLS) method is developed. Compared with the previous approaches, the new method significantly improves the performance of quality-related fault detection. In addition, it reduces the number of required latent variables, thus it has a quite lower computational load than the previous ones.

The baseline controller is obtained by an iterative LMI method, which not only stabilizes the uncertain system but also provides sufficient robustness to allow for an effective operation of the fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) subsystem in the event of actuator failures. The re-allocation scheme redesigns an optimal control law without requiring reconfiguration of the baseline controller, and compensates for actuator saturation via cascaded generalized inverse (CGI) method.

  abstract = {The problem of fault detection and isolation/identification (FDI) of nonlinear systems using neural networks is considered in this paper. The proposed FDI approach employs recurrent neural network-based observers for simultaneously detecting, isolating and identifying the severity of actuator faults in presence of disturbances and uncertainties in the model and sensory measurements. The neural network weights are updated based on a modified dynamic backpropagation scheme. The proposed FDI scheme does not rely on the availability of full state measurements. In most works in the literature the fault function acts as an additive term on the actuator, whereas in this work the fault acts as a multiplicative term. This will make the formal stability and convergence analysis of the overall FDI scheme nontrivial and challenging. Our stability analysis considers the presence of plant and sensor uncertainties through the use of Lyapunov's direct method with no restrictive assumptions on the system and/or the FDI algorithm. The performance of our proposed FDI approach is evaluated through simulations that are performed for two case studies, namely FDI of 1) reaction wheel type actuators that are commonly utilized in the attitude control subsystem (ACS) of a satellite and 2) actuators in a two-link flexible joint manipulator.},

Specifically, the goal is to decide whether a bus voltage fault, a current loss fault or a temperature fault has occurred in one of the three reaction wheels and further to localize which wheel is faulty. In order to achieve these objectives, three dynamic neural networks are introduced to model the dynamics of the wheels on all three axes independently. Due to the dynamic property of the wheel, the architecture utilized is the Elman recurrent network with backpropagation learning algorithm. The effectiveness of this neural network-based FDI scheme is investigated and a comparative study is conducted with the performance of a generalized observer-based scheme. The simulation results have demonstrated the advantages of the neural network-based method proposed.},

A model-based adaptive nonlinear parameter estimation technique is used based on a highly accurate reaction wheel dynamical model while each parameter is an indication of a specific type of fault in the system. The estimation is based on the nonlinear finite-memory filtering strategy that is solved for optimal estimation functions. To make the optimization feasible for on-line application, the optimal estimation functions are approximated by MLP neural networks thus reducing the functional optimization problem to a nonlinear programming problem, namely, the optimization of the neural weights. The well-known standard back-propagation algorithm and backpropagation through-time algorithm were employed inside the neural adaptation algorithms to obtain the required gradients.

  abstract = {Although satellites are designed with high reliability, faults do occur when satellites are in orbit. To avoid the important services being affected, redundancy is used in satellites. There are many sensors in satellites. In order to reduce the cost, space, weight and power consumption, redundant sensors should be added to satellite as few as possible. Analytical redundancy is an efficient way to optimize the application of redundant. The gyroscope is the attitude determination sensor of the satellite. The minimum redundant structure of the gyroscope system is as follows: three gyroscopes installed in three-axis orthogonally and one gyroscope installed with slantwise for redundancy(3o+1S). To achieve fault detection, identification and reconstruction, hypothesis of statistical independence between the three-axis angular rates and hypothesis of statistical independence between the angular rates and fault are proposed. The scenario that only one sensor is faulting and there are only additive fault and full fault is supposed. Under these assumptions, firstly a threshold method is used for fault detection. After a fault is detected, independent component analysis (ICA) based algorithm for fault identification is employed. To overcome the ambiguities of ICA, correlation coefficients and prior information of the mixed matrix are used. Finally, the reconstruction matrix is obtained. By using this matrix fault signal is extracted so that the yaw, roll and pitch axes (three-axis) angular rates of the satellite can be recovered. Numerical simulations show this method can fulfill fault detection, identification and reconstruction of the gyroscope system. },

  abstract = {Spacecraft are generally designed with very high reliability to operate for many years through fault avoidance practices. But, in spite of fault avoidance, faults do occur. Hence there is a need for on-board fault detection and isolation without creating significant degradation in the spacecraft services. Analytical redundancy or model reference method of fault detection provides such a solution as most spacecraft are now equipped with an on-board computer, which is an ideal platform for implementing the analytical redundancy based fault detection algorithms. In this paper, analytical redundancy based fault detection technique has been applied for detecting the faults in gyroscopes used in a three-axis stabilized low earth orbiting satellite like the Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) spacecraft. The scheme proposed is an observer based on a dynamic model having attitude and rates as states and the gyro sensed rates and the horizon sensor outputs as measurements. The torque computed by the \{AOCS\} processor is used as the control input for this observer. Eigen-structure assignment approach has been applied to the design of this dedicated fault detection observer. Design exercise has been carried out using \{MATLAB\} tools. Spacecraft dynamics and kinematic equations, the models for gyroscopes and the other sensors, the on-orbit normal mode controller have been included in the simulations. Extensive simulation studies have been conducted to validate the design and the results are presented. It is believed that this approach will help in achieving the larger goal of autonomy in spacecraft.},

  abstract = {Partial least squares (PLS) is an efficient tool widely used in multivariate statistical process monitoring. Since standard PLS performs oblique projection to input space X, it has limitations in distinguishing quality-related and quality-unrelated faults. Several postprocessing modifications of PLS, such as total projection to latent structures (T-PLS), have been proposed to solve this issue. Further studies have found that these modifications fail to reduce false alarm rates (FARs) of quality-unrelated faults when fault amplitude increases. To cope with this problem, this paper proposes an enhanced quality-related fault detection approach based on orthogonal signal correction (OSC) and modified-PLS (M-PLS). The proposed approach removes variation orthogonal to output space Y from input space X before PLS modeling, and further decomposes X into two orthogonal subspaces in which quality-related and quality-unrelated statistical indicators are designed separately. Compared with T-PLS, the proposed approach has a more robust performance and a lower computational load. Two case studies, including a numerical example and the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process, show the effeteness of the proposed approach.},

In the nonlinear system FDI application, the main idea consists of representing each failure mode by a model and combining the outputs of EKF's based on different models in a near-optimal way. This IMM-FDI filter provides not only failure detection and identification but also a near-optimal estimate of the system state (even during a failure). The approach has been applied successfully to a problem of spacecraft autonomy for the detection and identification of sensor (gyro, star tracker) and actuator failures. The results of this application show that IMM-EKF detects and identifies failures much more rapidly and reliably than the multi-hypothesis EKF. Furthermore, it handles satisfactorily both permanent and transient failures.

The control allocation scheme incorporates the novel use of actuator effectiveness levels to redistribute the control signals to the functioning healthy actuators when a fault or failure occurs, within a sliding mode framework. The paper will discuss the design issues associated with the controller – including the design of the sliding surface, the nonlinear gain required to maintain sliding, and sufficient conditions to ensure the closed –loop system remains stable for a class of faults and failures. },

A new approach to manage the actuators redundancy in the presence of loss of control effectiveness is proposed in this paper. The aim is to maintain systems performance both in the nominal behavior and after faults occurrence. In degraded actuator conditions, a reconfigured control allocation strategy is proposed based on the on-line re-estimation of actuators health. Benefit of incorporating the health indicators on the controller design is to manage properly the redundant actuators taking into account the degraded performance of the actuators induced by faults. The proposed approach is illustrated with a flight control application. },

The analysis is developed for a system consisting of a fixed number of actuators. In addition, the system includes a scheme to detect failures in individual actuators and, as a consequence, switch between different control algorithms for automatic operation of the actuators. Existing dynamic reliability analysis methods are insufficient for this class of systems because the coverage parameters for different actuator failures can be time-varying, correlated, and difficult to obtain in practice. We address these issues by combining new fault detection performance metrics with pivotal decomposition. These new metrics capture the interactions in different fault detection channels, and can be computed from stochastic models of fault detection algorithms. Our approach also decouples the high dimensional analysis problem into low dimensional sub-problems, yielding a computationally efficient analysis. Finally, we demonstrate the proposed method on a numerical example. The analysis results are also verified by Monte Carlo simulations. },

This paper proposes an improved faults detection, reconstruction and fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme for motor systems (MS) with typical faults. For this purpose, a sliding mode controller (SMC) with an integral sliding surface is adopted. This controller can make the output of system to track the desired position reference signal in finite-time and obtain a better dynamic response and anti-disturbance performance. But this controller cannot deal directly with total system failures. However an appropriate combination of the adopted \{SMC\} and sliding mode observer (SMO), later it is designed to on-line detect and reconstruct the faults and also to give a sensorless control strategy which can achieve tolerance to a wide class of total additive failures. The closed-loop stability is proved, using the Lyapunov stability theory. Simulation results in healthy and faulty conditions confirm the reliability of the suggested framework. },

Also this method does not require exact knowledge of the actuator faults and is implemented with uncertain value of fault information. By adjusting a simple parameter dynamically and using Lyapunov direct method and the properties of quaternion representation, the ultimate boundedness of attitude and angular velocity errors in presence of external disturbances is proven.

Compared with the well-developed model-based approaches, data-based techniques provide efficient alternative solutions for different industrial issues under various operating conditions. The main objective of this paper is to review and summarize the recent achievements in data-based techniques, especially for complicated industrial applications, thus providing a referee for further study on the related topics both from academic and practical points of view. This paper begins with a brief evolutionary overview of data-based techniques in the last two decades.

  abstract  = {In this paper, the problem of robust H∞ control is considered for a class of networked switched systems (NCS) with state unavailable. The faults are assumed to occur from the sensor to the controller and from the controller to the actuator, simultaneously. The missing probability for each channel of the sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator is different and is governed by a random variable that satisfying certain probabilistic distribution in the interval [0, θ] (θ ≥ 1). First, an observer-based feedback controller is designed. And then, by adopting the average dwell time method, a sufficient condition for the mean-square exponential stability and a guaranteed H∞ performance of the system is obtained.

The faults of each sensor or actuator occur randomly and their failure rates are governed by two sets of unrelated random variables satisfying certain probabilistic distribution. In terms of the probabilistic failures of every sensor or actuator, new type of distribution-based NCS fault model is proposed. Based on the new built model, reliable controller is designed and sufficient conditions for the exponentially mean square stability (EMSS) of NCS are obtained by using Lyapunov functional method. The main contribution of the proposed fault model and methods lies with its practicality and generalisation, which contains many realistic problems in the NCS, such as probabilistic sensors or actuators failures, partial degradation, data distortion, packet dropout, network-induced delay and so on. Moreover, some existing models in the open literatures are deemed as special cases of the proposed fault model.

  abstract  = {Recently, there has been a renewed interest in the parameter space approach to control system analysis and design. The original concept has a long history starting in Russia by Vishnegradsky in 1876 and spreading throughout the world by the works of Neimark, Aizerman, Mitrovic, Meerov, Thaler, Seltzer, Ackermann, and many others. The parameter space approach has generally been viewed as an alternative to the classical methods of Routh-Hurwitz, Nyquist, Evans, Bode, and Nichols. When in the sixties the advent of the LQG theory of Kalman decreased the interest in classical design techniques, it almost diminished applications of the parameter methods. A recent widespread interest in robust design of control systems subject to structured perturbations shifted a considerable part of the research activity toward parameter space methods, and, at the same time, enlarged the scope of the approach to include the Liapunov's method as well as frequency domain concepts. The purpose of this paper is to review new and significant developments in the robust control design for structured (parametric) perturbations, which complement the large and well represented effort in robust design of control systems under structured and unstructured perturbations via frequency domain characterizations. A critical comparison of various parameter space concepts and methods is offered and examples are used to illustrate some of the differences between various results available at present. Directions for future research are suggested, which are motivated by applications as well as by utilization of modern computing technology. The paper is organized in three sections as follows.},

To reduce unnecessary transmissions in the network, a hybrid-driven scheme is introduced, in which the communication transmission scheme can be selected between time-driven scheme and event-driven scheme. The switch law of the communication schemes is modeled as Bernoulli distributed stochastic variable. Considering the network-induced delay, nonlinear perturbations and the probabilistic actuator faults, a new model is constructed under the hybrid driven scheme. By using Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals and stochastic analysis techniques, sufficient conditions are established which ensure the asymptotical stability of the augmented system under hybrid driven scheme. Furthermore, a unified co-design algorithm for the desired controller and the hybrid-driven scheme are developed. Finally, a typical simulation example is used to demonstrate the validity of obtained results. },

It outlines the principles and most important techniques of model-based residual generation using parameter identification and state estimation methods with emphasis upon the latest attempts to achieve robustness with respect to modelling errors. A solution to the fundamental problem of robust fault detection, providing the maximum achievable robustness by decoupling the effects of faults from each other and from the effects of modelling errors, is given. This approach not only completes the theory but is also of great importance for practical applications. For the case where the prerequisites for complete decoupling are not given, two approximate solutions—one in the time domain and one in the frequency domain—are presented, and the crossconnections to earlier approaches are evidenced. The resulting observer schemes for robust instrument fault detection, component fault detection, and actuator fault detection are briefly discussed. Finally, the basic scheme of fault diagnosis using a combination of analytical and knowledge-based redundancy is outlined.},

  abstract = {For further improvement of the reliability and safety of machines the automatic early detection and localization of faults is of high interest. The conventional approach is to monitor some important variables like temperature, pressure, vibration and to generate alarms if certain limits are exceeded. However, developing internal faults are in this way only detected at a rather late stage. By applying static and dynamic process models and common process input and output measurements the inherent relationships and redundancies can be used to detect faults earlier and to localize them better. Changes in process and signal parameters are very well suited for fault detection. The paper describes a general methodology for machines and other processes by using few measurements, dynamic process and signal models and parameter estimation to generate analytical symptoms. Heuristic symptoms observed by the operator or based on, e.g. the process history are another source for fault diagnosis. Both kinds of symptoms are weighted by confidence measures and are fed into a knowledge based fault diagnosis procedure. The diagnosis is performed by forward and backward chaining according to causal fault-symptom trees. The considered machines consist of a motor, a drive chain and a working process or load. They may be electrical motor or combustion engine driven pumps, fans or machine tools with gear or belt drive chains. As one example, experimental results are shown for a DC motor powered feed drive of a machine tool. A summary of practical results with other machines is also given.},

  abstract = {Often in control design it is necessary to construct estimates of state variables which are not available by direct measurement. If a system is linear, its state vector can be approximately reconstructed by building an observer which is itself a linear system driven by the available outputs and inputs of the original system. The state vector of annth order system withmindependent outputs can be reconstructed with an observer of ordern-m. In this paper it is shown that the design of an observer for a system withMoutputs can be reduced to the design ofmseparate observers for single-output subsystems. This result is a consequence of a special canonical form developed in the paper for multiple-output systems. In the special case of reconstruction of a single linear functional of the unknown state vector, it is shown that a great reduction in observer complexity is often possible. Finally, the application of observers to control design is investigated. It is shown that an observer's estimate of the system state vector can be used in place of the actual state vector in linear or nonlinear feedback designs without loss of stability.},

A new \{FDI\} method is developed using adaptive estimation techniques. The \{FDI\} architecture consists of a fault detection estimator and a bank of fault isolation estimators. The fault detectability and isolability conditions, characterizing the class of faults that are detectable and isolable by the proposed scheme, are rigorously established. The fault isolability condition is derived via the so-called fault mismatch functions, which are defined to characterize the mutual difference between pairs of possible faults. A simulation example of a single-link flexible joint robot is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. },

  abstract = {The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is one of the most popular model-based techniques for fault detection and diagnosis. Although its effectiveness has been widely recognized, the practical applications of EKFs are still very limited. This is due to the fact that the estimates of EKF are often biased when the occurrence of multiple faults is possible. In this study, we have extended the findings of our previous research on diagnostic observability and diagnostic resolution concerning a set of parallel single-parameter EKFs (Chang et al., 1993, A.I.Ch.E. J.39, 1146) to the multiple-parameter EKFs which are designed to identify more than one fault origin. The problems in implementing these EKFs, i.e. misdiagnosis due to biased estimates and heavy computation load due to the parallel configuration, have been solved with a selection strategy for proper combinations of sensor locations and EKF parameters. More importantly, simple procedures have been developed to quickly evaluate the performance of any given system and the reliability of the proposed approach has been repeatedly confirmed in extensive simulation studies without exceptions. As a result, it becomes feasible to construct appropriate fault monitoring schemes without extensive computational effort even for large and complex chemical processes.},

Performance comparisons are made between filters using the inertial navigation equations and the dynamic model for the fault-free conditions. It is shown that a matched UKF will result in adequate state estimation regardless of the failure mode and that the IMM-UKF algorithm is a step closer to achieving the same performance.

However, there is always some mismatch between the modeled and the real process behavior. Then, any model-based fault detection algorithm should be robust against modeling errors. One possible approach to take into account modeling uncertainty is to include all the uncertainty in system parameters using an interval model that allows generating an adaptive threshold. In this paper, the use of interval models in robust fault detection considering three schemes (simulation, prediction, or observation) is presented and discussed. The main contribution is to present a comparative study that allows identifying the benefits and drawbacks of using each scheme. This study will provide a guideline for the use of the proposed fault detection schemes in real applications. Finally, an intelligent servoactuator, proposed as a benchmark in the context of European Research Training Network DAMADICS, is used to illustrate the application and the comparative study of these interval-based fault detection schemes.},

In order to ensure reliable fault detection, the adaptive threshold technique is used to deal with the problem. The paper focuses also on the N-F model design procedure. The bounded-error approach is applied to generate rules for the model using available data.

The parity relations are applied directly to the observables of the monitored plant; the design relies on the plant's dynamic input-output model. This residual generator can be made computationally polynomial (moving average) by including the invariant zero polynomial of the fault system in the specified fault responses. The polynomial design yields moving average noise transfers as well. White noise transfer and disturbance decoupling are achieved by extending the response specification. The parity relation approach is compared with the traditional detection filter design, and is shown to be more straightforward and have milder existence conditions; if subjected to the same specification, the two approaches yield identical residual generators.},

The emphasis is on modelling errors, represented as multiplicative disturbances, and on parametric faults. These are both characterized as discrepancies in a set of underlying parameters. The residuals are obtained using parity equations. To address the situation when the number of uncertain parameters is too high to allow perfect decoupling, two approximate decoupling methods are introduced. One utilizes rank reduction of the model-error/fault entry matrix via singular value decomposition. The other minimizes a least squares performance index, formulated on the residuals, under a set of equality constraints. It is shown that, by the appropriate construction of the entry matrix or of the performance index and the constraints, a broad variety of structured and directional residual strategies can be implemented. },

  abstract = { Fault detection filters are a special class of observers that can generate directional residuals for the purpose of fault isolation. This paper proposes a new approach to design robust (in the disturbance de-coupling sense) fault detection filters which ensure that the residual vector, generated by this filter, has both robust and directional properties. This is done by combining the unknown input observer and fault detection filter principles. The paper proposes a new full-order unknown input observer, and gives necessary and sufficient conditions for its existence. After the disturbance de-coupling conditions are satisfied, the remaining design freedom can be used to make the residual have the directional property, based on the fault detection filter principle. A nonlinear jet engine system is used to illustrate the robust fault isolation approach presented. It is shown that linearization errors can be approximately treated as unknown disturbances and be de-coupled in the design of a robust fault detection filter. Simulation results show that mis-isolation of faults can be avoided using the robust scheme. },

  abstract  = {With an emphasis on fault isolation and by treating fault detection as a byproduct of fault isolation, both actuator and sensor fault detection and isolation (FDI) problems for a class of uncertain Lipschitz nonlinear systems are studied using an unknown input observer (UIO) design technique. To solve the actuator fault detection and isolation problem, we develop a particular system structure by regrouping the system inputs, which is suitable for UIO design. By filtering the regrouped outputs properly, the same system structure can be developed for sensor fault detection and isolation problem, which allows us to treat the sensor fault detection and isolation problem as an actuator fault detection and isolation problem. To accomplish FDI efficiently, a novel full order nonlinear UIO is designed with a special property suitable for fault isolation purposes and a necessary and sufficient condition for its existence are presented. The LMI based sufficient condition enables the designers to use Matlab LMI toolbox and makes the computationally difficult UIO design much easier. For UIO based FDI, the following three problems are investigated: 1) under what conditions is it possible to isolate single and/or multiple faults? 2) What is the maximum number of faults that can be isolated simultaneously? 3) How to design fault isolation schemes to achieve multiple fault isolation (that is, to make decisions on how many faults have occurred and the location of each fault)? Conditions for problem 1) are derived and the maximum number of faults that can be isolated is determined for problem 2) to solve problem 3) an FDI scheme is designed using a bank of nonlinear UIOs and its design procedure is presented in a step by step fashion. An example is given to show how to use the proposed FDI scheme and simulations results illustrate that the proposed technique works well for FDI in uncertain Lipschitz nonlinear systems},

At the heart of this approach is a robust estimator for which the necessary and sufficient conditions to its existence are outlined. The robust estimator can simultaneously estimate the unmeasurable state variables of the system for the purpose of control and provide necessary information for FDI purposes. A novel feature of this approach is that it can actually identify the shape and magnitude of the failures. The scheme allows for fast and accurate FDI, and can account for structural uncertainties and variations in the parameters of the dynamical model of the system.

The key idea here is to decompose a given system into several (chained) subsystems, and then to apply a conventional control method for these subsystems in sequence. As for the conventional part, we adopt the time-state control method. The proposed strategy guarantees convergence of the state to an arbitrarily given neighborhood of the origin. Finally, with a numerical example, we show that a new type of mobile robot which can be approximated by a system in the class applied to the strategy is valid as well.},

A two-step design procedure is proposed to derive non-conservative robust \{FDI\} filters. The first step consists of designing an optimal \{FDI\} filter that maximizes fault sensitivity performance and simultaneously minimizes the influence of unknown inputs, for a large class of model perturbations. The design problem is formulated so that all free parameters are optimized via Linear Matrix Inequality techniques. The second step consists of a systematic post-design analysis procedure. A test is proposed to check if all \{FDI\} objectives are achieved for all specified model perturbations. The problem is formulated using an appropriate performance index over a specified frequency range. The solution is based on the generalized structured singular value. Finally, experimental results from a pilot laboratory system are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. },

By using some recent results of H∞ optimization, a solution of the optimization problem is then presented via a linear matrix inequality (LMI) formulation.

Two basic approaches will be considered, these apply differential algebraic and differential geometric tools. In the differential algebraic approach the state elimination methods will be used to derive nonlinear parity relations. In the specific case when a reconstruction of the fault signal is needed the dynamic inversion based approach will be investigated. This approach will also be studied from geometric point of view. The geometric approach, as proposed by Isidori and De Persis, is suitable to extend the detection filter and unknown input observer design approaches (well elaborated for \{LTI\} systems) to affine nonlinear systems. Beyond the development of the theory of fault detection and identification it is equally important to offer computable methods and to analyze the robustness properties against uncertainties. Both the observer based and the inversion based approaches will be elaborated for \{LPV\} systems that may offer computational tools inherited from linear systems and also allow to design for robustness utilizing results from H ∞ robust filtering and disturbance attenuation. },

  abstract = { In this article the idea of inversion-based direct input reconstruction for robust detection, separation and estimation of multiple simultaneous faults in the presence of persistent disturbances which proved to be non-separable by conventional decoupling methods in linear dynamical systems is presented. In particular, it is shown how in a specific filtering structure a residual generator, relying on the inverse representation of the system, by means of estimation of the inverse dynamics can be designed providing robust fault decoupling. In the development of the method three solution approaches are contrasted with each other. In the first approach the traditional H ∞ filter providing the classical disturbance attenuated non-decoupling solution is presented. Then, in a novel solution, an H ∞ detection filter on the inverse system is designed providing detection residuals by exact fault decoupling; the estimation of the inverse dynamics is obtained by means of the optimal filter, thus ensuring H ∞ disturbance attenuation on the residual output. Finally, an observer-based residual generator for the estimation of the inverse dynamics is designed resulting in detection residuals with exact fault and disturbance separation, which characterises this novel idea in its extremes. The feasibility of the solution to problems not solvable earlier is demonstrated based on an aircraft monitoring application example that was originally considered in Douglas and Speyer (1995) and Chung and Speyer (1998). },

Estimates of first-order derivatives of some state variables are thus readily available and allow one to estimate the control inputs as achieved by the actuators. Since the computed control input sent to the actuator is known, it is possible to use the discrepancy between these two elements as a residual indicative of faults.

  abstract = {A foundation for an integrated approach to the design of controls and diagnostics in reliable control systems is presented. The control module and diagnostic module of the control system are designed together, instead of independently, thereby accounting for the interactions which occur between these two modules in a functioning control system. The four-parameter controller, a generalization of the two-parameter controller, is used. This controller has two vector inputs and two vector outputs, and, correspondingly, is composed of four matrix parameters. The additional contlts. A parameterization of all four parameter controllers is developed. The fundamental limitations roller output may be viewed as a diagnostic output which is monitored to detect and isolate sensor and actuator fauand inherent tradeoffs governing the design of controls and diagnostics are delineated. Special attention is given to the issues of control/diagnostic interaction and uncertainty. Several means for resolving these design tradeoffs are proposed and illustrated by an example involving a jet engine.<>},

The FDI design problem is analyzed both in the case where the control input signal is considered as a known external input signal (open loop) and when the input signal is generated by a feedback controller},
